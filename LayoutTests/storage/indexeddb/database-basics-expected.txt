PASS trans !== null is true
Deleted all object stores.
Testing setVersion.

Now that the connection is closed, transaction creation should fail
Expecting exception from db.transaction('test123')
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is IDBDatabaseException.NOT_ALLOWED_ERR
Call twice, make sure it's harmless
db.close()
PASS successfullyParsed is true
