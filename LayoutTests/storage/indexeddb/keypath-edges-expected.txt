Test IndexedDB keyPath edge cases

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Key path doesn't resolve to a value; should yield null, should throw DATA_ERR
Expecting exception from store.put(null)
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is IDBDatabaseException.DATA_ERR

Key path doesn't resolve to a value; should yield null, should throw DATA_ERR
Expecting exception from store.put({})
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is IDBDatabaseException.DATA_ERR

Key path resolves to a value that is invalid key; should yield 'invalid' key, should throw DATA_ERR
Expecting exception from store.put({foo: null})
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is IDBDatabaseException.DATA_ERR

Key path resolves to a value that is valid key; should yield 'string' key, should succeed
store.put({foo: 'zoo'})
PASS store.put succeeded

Key path doesn't resolve to a value; should yield null, put request should raise error event
