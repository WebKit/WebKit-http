Try to call db.close() after upgradeneeded but before the corresponding success event fires

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB = self.indexedDB || self.webkitIndexedDB || self.mozIndexedDB || self.msIndexedDB || self.OIndexedDB;

dbname = "intversion-close-between-events.html"
indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)
request = indexedDB.open(dbname, 7)


upgradeNeeded():
db = event.target.result
PASS event.newVersion is 7
db.createObjectStore('objectstore')
transaction = event.target.transaction

transaction.oncomplete:
sawTransactionComplete = true
setTimeout(closeDB, 0)

openSuccess():
PASS didCallCloseDB is false
PASS sawTransactionComplete is true
db = event.target.result
PASS db.version is 7
PASS db.objectStoreNames.length is 1
db.transaction(db.objectStoreNames)

closeDB():
didCallCloseDB = true
db.close()
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
