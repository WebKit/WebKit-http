Test that pending transactions are not aborted during recursive JS calls until all JS (in all frames) is finished.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS 'webkitIndexedDB' in window is true
PASS webkitIndexedDB == null is false
webkitIndexedDB.open('transaction-abort-with-js-recursion-cross-frame')
db = event.target.result
db.setVersion('new version')
pendingTransaction = db.transaction(['objectStore'], webkitIDBTransaction.READ_WRITE)
Start re-entrant JS
transaction = db.transaction(['objectStore'], webkitIDBTransaction.READ_WRITE)
End re-entrant JS
store = pendingTransaction.objectStore('objectStore')
PASS store !== undefined is true
Pending transaction aborted
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
