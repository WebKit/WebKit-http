This tests copying and pasting text does not strip inline styles that overrides UA style rules.
To manually test, copy and paste "hello world" below. The pasted text should be bolded.

Before copy-paste:
| <b>
|   style="font-weight: normal"
|   "<#selection-caret>hello world"

After copy-paste:
| <b>
|   style="font-weight: normal; "
|   "hello world<#selection-caret>"
| <br>
