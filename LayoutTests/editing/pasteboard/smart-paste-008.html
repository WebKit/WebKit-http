<p>There was a bug in paste's smart replace whitespace handling.  In some cases, it used information gathered at the start of the selection being pasted into to decide whether or not a space needed to be added to the end of the incoming content.</p>
<p>A smart paste is performed into a selection starting in one block and ending in another.  Spaces should surround the pasted word.</p>
<div id="test" contenteditable="true"><div>foo</div><div>x bar</div></div>
