This test verifies that inserting paragraph twice at the end of last listitem created with custom tag and display:list-item does not remove entire list.
Expected behavior is list should not be removed and one empty line should get added.

        "
| <p>
|   "Paragraph before list."
| "
        "

|   <item>
|     "First Item"

            "
|   <item>
|     id="target"
|     "Second Item<#selection-caret>"
