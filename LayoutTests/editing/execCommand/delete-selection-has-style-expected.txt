This tests deleting a selection that has a styling element in it. Should move styling elements to head to prevent style loss.

styling elements have been moved:
| "
        "
| <div>
|   <#selection-caret>
|   <br>
| "
    "
| <style>
|   " .text { color:red; } "
| <link>
|   href="../editingStyle.css"
|   rel="stylesheet"
|   type="text/css"

styling elements are back to their original place:
| "
        "
| <div>
|   " <#selection-anchor>hide styling elements in --> "
| "
        "
| <style>
|   " .text { color:red; } "
| "
        "
| <link>
|   href="../editingStyle.css"
|   rel="stylesheet"
|   type="text/css"
| "
        "
| <div>
|   class="text"
|   " between<#selection-focus> "
| "
    "
