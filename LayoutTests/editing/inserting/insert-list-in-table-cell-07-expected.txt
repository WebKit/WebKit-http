Exec insertOrderedList twice in all the cells of a table removes the previously inserted list items:

Before:
| <#selection-focus>
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     id="element"
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         <#selection-anchor>
|         "fsdf"
|       <td>
|         "fsdf"
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "gghfg"
|       <td>
|         "fsfg"
|   <tbody>

After:
| <#selection-caret>
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     id="element"
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "fsdf"
|       <td>
|         "fsdf"
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "gghfg"
|       <td>
|         "fsfg"
