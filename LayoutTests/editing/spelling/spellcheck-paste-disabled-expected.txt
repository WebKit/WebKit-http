Test if WebKit does not spellcheck text when pasting text to an element having spellchecking disabled. To test manually, copy the text "zz apple" and paste it to the textarea. When "zz" is not marked as misspelled, this test succeeds.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS internals.hasSpellingMarker(0, 2) is true
PASS internals.hasSpellingMarker(0, 2) is false
