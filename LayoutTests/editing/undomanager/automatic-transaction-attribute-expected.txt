This tests that UndoManager correctly reverts/reapplies automatic DOM transactions on attribute changes. We start with a span that has blue border and doesn't have title or contenteditable attributes. 

PASS transact 1: set title to "test" 
PASS transact 2: set contenteditable to "true" 
PASS transact 3: set border color to red 
PASS transact 4: remove attribute title 
PASS undo 4: title is back to "test" 
PASS undo 3: border color is back to blue 
PASS undo 2: contenteditable is back to "inherit" 
PASS undo 1: title is back to an empty string 
PASS redo 1: title is "test" again 
PASS redo 2: contentEditable is "true" again 
PASS redo 3: border color is red again 
PASS redo 4: title is an empty string again
