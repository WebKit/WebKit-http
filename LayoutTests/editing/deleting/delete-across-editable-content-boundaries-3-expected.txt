This tests to see that selected editable nodes that are not in both the start and end editable roots are cleared.  You should see one non-editable piece and an editable one and then two empty table cells.  The table cells are editable but are preserved and not removed because they are in a non-editable region.  They should be completely cleared out, even the second one that contains a non-editable piece. <radr://problem/5026848>
