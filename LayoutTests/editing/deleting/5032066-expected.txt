This tests deleting when the caret is at the start of a paragraph just after a table.  The content in that paragraph should be moved into the last table cell unless that content is another table.
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "All the content in this editable regionÂ <#selection-caret>"
|         <span>
|           class="Apple-style-span"
|           style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; "
|           "should be in one table cell."
