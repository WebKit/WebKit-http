Harness Error (FAIL), message = TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.error')

PASS Aborting a WritableStream immediately prevents future writes 
PASS Aborting a WritableStream prevents further writes after any that are in progress 
PASS Fulfillment value of ws.abort() call must be undefined even if the underlying sink returns a non-undefined value 
PASS WritableStream if sink's abort throws, the promise returned by ws.abort() rejects 
PASS Aborting a WritableStream passes through the given reason 
PASS Aborting a WritableStream puts it in an errored state, with stored error equal to the abort reason 
PASS Aborting a WritableStream causes any outstanding ready promises to be fulfilled immediately 
PASS Aborting a WritableStream causes any outstanding write() promises to be rejected with the abort reason 
PASS Closing but then immediately aborting a WritableStream causes the stream to error 
PASS Closing a WritableStream and aborting it while it closes causes the stream to error 
PASS Aborting a WritableStream after it is closed is a no-op 
PASS WritableStream should call underlying sink's close if no abort is supplied
