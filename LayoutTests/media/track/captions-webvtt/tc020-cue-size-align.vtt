Valid cue size with alignment settings.

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.500 S:100% A:start
Bear is Coming!!!!!
Box for the cue is 100% of the video viewport width
and because of the start align, all text is left aligned on the video viewport.

2
00:00:31.000 --> 00:01:00.500 S:10% A:end
I said Bear is coming!!!!
Box for the cue is 10% of the video viewport width, which will mean that automatic line wrapping will happen
and the text is aligned to the end.

3
00:01:01.000 --> 00:02:00.500 S:0% A:middle
I said Bear is coming now!!!!
Cue text box size of 0 is acceptable, even if not visible.
