Tests that TextTrack's cues are indexed and updated within 500ms during video playback. Test uses the enter and exits events on TextTrackCue.

This test may fail occasionally since we cannot guarantee that cue events will fire within 250ms of their startTime or endTime.

EVENT(canplaythrough)
EXPECTED (testTrack.track.cues.length == '3') OK
RUN(video.play())

EVENT(enter)
This cue is the currently active cue:
EXPECTED ([object TextTrackCue] == '[object TextTrackCue]') OK
Start time:
EXPECTED (video.currentTime >= '1') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime < '1.5') OK

EVENT(exit)
End time:
EXPECTED (video.currentTime >= '2') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime < '2.5') OK

EVENT(enter)
This cue is the currently active cue:
EXPECTED ([object TextTrackCue] == '[object TextTrackCue]') OK
Start time:
EXPECTED (video.currentTime >= '2.5') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime < '3') OK

EVENT(exit)
End time:
EXPECTED (video.currentTime >= '3.5') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime < '4') OK

EVENT(enter)
This cue is the currently active cue:
EXPECTED ([object TextTrackCue] == '[object TextTrackCue]') OK
