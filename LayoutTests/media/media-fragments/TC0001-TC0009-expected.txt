Title: TC0002

Comment: Invalid semantics: start must be smaller than end. The media fragment is ignored.
EVENT(canplaythrough)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '0') OK
EXPECTED (video.initialTime == '0') OK

Title: TC0003
Fragment: 't=7,3'
Comment: Invalid semantics: the requested interval's start is beyond its end. The media fragment is ignored.

Title: TC0009
Fragment: 't=15,20'
Comment: The request lies beyond the end of the resource. If the UA knows the duration of the resource, it seeks to the end of the media resource. Otherwise, the UA will send an (out-of-range) HTTP request with an 'include-setup' in order to setup its decoding pipeline.
