  <!-- Use a fake font family for all of the text that we draw.
       The setTextSubpixelPositioning() call changes a global text style
       setting.  It gets reset after we're dumped, but if we run first, our
       style would be cached and would affect other tests, and if we run after
       another test, we'd use its cached style and subpixel positioning won't be
       enabled. -->
  <body style="font-family:SubpixelPositioning">

      if (window.testRunner) {
          testRunner.setTextSubpixelPositioning(true);
      }
    </script>

    <p>This test requires a Linux build of DumpRenderTree, as it needs to turn
    on subpixel positioning.</p>

    <p>This text should be rendered using subpixel positioning.  Glyphs should
    be placed at non-integral positions, and in the following string of repeated
    &quot;l&quot; characters, the glyphs should not all be rendered
    identically: llllllllllllllllllllll</p>
