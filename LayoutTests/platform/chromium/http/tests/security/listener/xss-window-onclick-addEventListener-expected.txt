CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 1: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://localhost:8000/security/resources/cross-frame-iframe.html from frame with URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/listener/resources/childWindow.html. Domains, protocols and ports must match.

This tests that frame used when setting eventListeners on the window using addEventListener is the window's frame. (rdar://problem/5426142). This test passes if you don't see an alert dialog with the domain of "localhost" in it and an "Unsafe JavaScript" warning is logged to the console.
