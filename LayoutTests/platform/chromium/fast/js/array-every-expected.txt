This test checks the behavior of the every() method on Array objects.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


1.0 Single Argument Testing
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnough) is false
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnough) is true

2.0 Two Argument Testing
PASS [12, 5, 10, 130, 44].every(isBigEnough, predicate) is false
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnough, predicate) is true

3.0 Array Mutation Tests

3.1 Array Element Removal
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndPop) is false
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndPop) is true

3.2 Array Element Changing
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndChange) is false
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndChange) is false

3.3 Array Element Addition
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndPush) is false
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndPush) is false

4.0 Exception Test
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndException) threw exception exception from function.
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughAndException) threw exception exception from function.

5.0 Wrong Type for Callback Test
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(5) threw exception TypeError: 5 is not a function.
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every('wrong') threw exception TypeError: wrong is not a function.
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(new Object()) threw exception TypeError: #<Object> is not a function.
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(null) threw exception TypeError: null is not a function.
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(undefined) threw exception TypeError: undefined is not a function.
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every() threw exception TypeError: undefined is not a function.

6.0 Early Exit ("Short Circuiting")
PASS [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughShortCircuit) is false
PASS accumulator.toString() is [12, 5].toString()
PASS [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnoughShortCircuit) is true
PASS accumulator.toString() is [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].toString()

7.0 Behavior for Holes in Arrays
PASS arr.every(isNotUndefined) is true
PASS arr.every(isNotUndefined) is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true
