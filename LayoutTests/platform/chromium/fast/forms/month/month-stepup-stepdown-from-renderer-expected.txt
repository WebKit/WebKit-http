Check stepping-up and -down for month input fields from renderer. No cases of empty initial values.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Function arguments are (value, step, {min or max}, [stepCount]).
Normal cases
FAIL stepUp("2010-02", null, null) should be 2010-03. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepDown("2010-02", null, null) should be 2010-01. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepUp("2010-02", null, null, 10) should be 2010-12. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepDown("2010-02", null, null, 11) should be 2009-03. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepUp("1970-01", "4", null, 2) should be 1970-09. Was 1970-01.
FAIL stepDown("1970-01", "4", null, 3) should be 1969-01. Was 1970-01.
Step=any
FAIL stepUp("2010-02", "any", null) should be 2010-03. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepDown("2010-02", "any", null) should be 2010-01. Was 2010-02.
Overflow/underflow
FAIL stepUp("2010-02", "3.40282346e+38", null) should be 275760-09. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepDown("2010-02", "3.40282346e+38", null) should be 1970-01. Was 2010-02.
PASS stepUp("2010-02", "1", "2010-02") is "2010-02"
PASS stepDown("2010-02", "1", "2010-02") is "2010-02"
stepDown()/stepUp() for stepMismatch values
FAIL stepDown("2010-02", "3", "2009-10") should be 2010-01. Was 2010-02.
FAIL stepUp("1970-02", "4", "") should be 1970-05. Was 1970-02.
