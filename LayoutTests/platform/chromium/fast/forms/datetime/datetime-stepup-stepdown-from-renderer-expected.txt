Check stepping-up and -down for datetime input fields from renderer. No cases of empty initial values.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Function arguments are (value, step, {min or max}, [stepCount]).

PASS stepUp("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "1", "2010-02-10T20:13Z") is "2010-02-10T20:13Z"
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "1", "2010-02-10T20:13Z") is "2010-02-10T20:13Z"
stepDown()/stepUp() for stepMismatch values
FAIL stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "3", "2010-02-10T20:12:56Z") should be 2010-02-10T20:12:59Z. Was 2010-02-10T20:13Z.
