StringObject-expected.txt
-----------------------------
The only difference from KJS is that
'a'.localeCompare(undefined/null) returns a negative number, but not -1. 
Spec states this is implementation dependent. Different versions of 
SpiderMonkey have different output.


encode_decode_uri
string-1-n
string-2-n
-----------------------------
Only differ in error message.


exception_propagation
-----------------------------
With KJS, a syntax error is thrown at compile time for the following
code:

  for (throwex() in forin_test_obj) { forin_count++; }

Spidermonkey and V8 throw an error at runtime instead and therefore
pass this test.


lval-exceptions
----------------------------
Only whitespace differences in the way functions are pretty printed.


parse
----------------------------
Only differ in error message.
