This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

eval-keyword-vs-function
eval-cross-window
--------------------------
Only difference is the value of toString() on the window object.

constructor-attributes
--------------------------
The only difference is that V8 defines the constructor attribute on the
prototype for DOM objects just as for other objects.
The V8 implementation is consistent with the JavaScript specification and IE.

function-dot-arguments-and-caller
--------------------------
The only difference is that V8 defines the caller of a custom toString function
as the function that calls toString() on the object. This treatment is
consistent with Firefox.  

exception-thrown-from-new
--------------------------
Exception text is different in v8
