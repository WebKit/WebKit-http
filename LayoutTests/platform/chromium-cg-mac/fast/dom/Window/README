This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

atob-btoa-expected.txt
--------------------------
window.btoa(window) calls window.toString first. KJS returns [object Window]
and V8 returns [object global].

element-constructors-on-window-exepcted.html
--------------------------
V8 has different output for HTMLElement.toString.

new-window-opener-expected.txt
------------------------------
It is a time-sensitive test. Chrome passes all tests, Safari failed some,
so the output expects some failures. Firefox sometimes passes all tests
and sometimes fails some. Use Chrome's output as the baseline.

window-custom-property
----------------------
V8 uses the string 'Cyclic' compared to KJS's 'cyclic' for the
exception, resulting in different test results.

window-property-shadowing
get-set-properties
-------------------------
For security reasons, we do not allow window.top to be shadowed.  This
is because Flash accesses top.location and allowing the user to shadow
top.location might therefore break Flash security checks.
