This test checks that markers are correct when auto correcting in the blockquote. If you type "l" and " ", there should be blue dots under the word: "notational". This test also makes sure that the replacement does not cause breaking out of blockquotes.

PASS internals.hasAutocorrectedMarker(document, 5, 10) is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true
