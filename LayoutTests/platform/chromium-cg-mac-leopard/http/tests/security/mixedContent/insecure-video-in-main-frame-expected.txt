CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 1: The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-video.html displayed insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/resources/test.ogv.

didDisplayInsecureContent
This test opens a window that loads an insecure video. We should trigger a mixed content callback because the main frame in the window is HTTPS but is displaying insecure content.
