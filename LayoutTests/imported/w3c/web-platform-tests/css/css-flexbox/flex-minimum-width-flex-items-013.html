  <!--
    content size suggestion is 300px.
    specified size suggestion is 100px.
    transferred size suggestion is 50px, but that is ignored because there is a
    specified size. The ignoring is from the spec text that says,
    (capitalization added):

    In general, the content-based minimum size of a flex item is the smaller of
    its content size suggestion and its specified size suggestion. However, if
    the box has an aspect ratio AND NO specified size, its content-based
    minimum size is the smaller of its content size suggestion and its
    transferred size suggestion.

    So here the content-based minimum size is min(300, 100) = 100.
