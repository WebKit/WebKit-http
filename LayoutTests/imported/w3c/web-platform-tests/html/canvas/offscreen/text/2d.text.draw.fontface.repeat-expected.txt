2d.text.draw.fontface.repeat

Draw with the font immediately, then wait a bit until and draw again. (This crashes some version of WebKit.)


FAIL Draw with the font immediately, then wait a bit until and draw again. (This crashes some version of WebKit.) ctx.fillText is not a function. (In 'ctx.fillText('AA', 0, 50)', 'ctx.fillText' is undefined)
