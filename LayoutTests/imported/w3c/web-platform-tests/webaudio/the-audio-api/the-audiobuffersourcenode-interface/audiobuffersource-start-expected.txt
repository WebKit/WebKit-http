PASS   Case 0: start(when): implicitly play whole buffer from beginning to end is identical to the array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...]. 
PASS   Case 0: start(when): implicitly play whole buffer from beginning to end: tail contains only the constant 0. 
PASS   Case 1: start(when, 0): play whole buffer from beginning to end explicitly giving offset of 0 is identical to the array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...].
