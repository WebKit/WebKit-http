In PrivateBrowsing mode, console messages are visible in the Console, but aren't sent to ChromeClients (or printf'd) in order to ensure they never end up in logs. Better safe than sorry.

log: This should show up once console messages are dumped, but should _not_ show up as a "CONSOLE MESSAGE:" at the top of the output.
