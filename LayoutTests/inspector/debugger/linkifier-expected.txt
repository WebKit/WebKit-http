Tests that Linkifier works correctly.

Two addEventListener calls expected. The first for 'fakeUrl-1' the second for 'fakeUrl-2'.
Two removeEventListener calls expected. The first for 'fakeUrl-1' the second for 'fakeUrl-2'.
Debugger was enabled.
--- linkify fakeURL-1 first time ---
DummyPresentationModel._rawSourceCodeForScriptWithURL was called with arguments = ['fakeUrl-1']
DummyRawSourceCode.addEventListener was called for source with URL = 'fakeUrl-1' with arguments = ['source-mapping-updated', function, object]

--- linkify fakeURL-2 first time ---
DummyPresentationModel._rawSourceCodeForScriptWithURL was called with arguments = ['fakeUrl-2']
DummyRawSourceCode.addEventListener was called for source with URL = 'fakeUrl-2' with arguments = ['source-mapping-updated', function, object]

--- linkify fakeURL-1 second time ---
DummyPresentationModel._rawSourceCodeForScriptWithURL was called with arguments = ['fakeUrl-1']

--- linkify fakeURL-2 second time ---
DummyPresentationModel._rawSourceCodeForScriptWithURL was called with arguments = ['fakeUrl-2']

--- reset ---
DummyRawSourceCode.removeEventListener was called for source with id = 'fakeUrl-1' with arguments = ['source-mapping-updated', function, object]
DummyRawSourceCode.removeEventListener was called for source with id = 'fakeUrl-2' with arguments = ['source-mapping-updated', function, object]
