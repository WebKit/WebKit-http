Welcome to the WebGL Conformance Test Suite
===========================================

This is the initial release of the WebGL conformance test suite.

NOTE TO USERS: Unless you are a WebGL implementor, there is no need to submit
a conformance result using this process.  Should you discover bugs in your
browser's WebGL implementation, either via this test suite or otherwise,
please report them through your browser vendor's bug tracking system.

FOR WEBGL IMPLEMENTORS: Please follow the instructions below to create
a formal conformance submission.

1) Open webgl-conformance-tests.html in your target browser

2) Press the "run tests" button

3) At the end of the run, press "display text summary"

4) Verify that the User Agent and WebGL renderer strings identify your browser and target correctly.

5) Copy the contents of the text summary (starting with "WebGL Conformance Test Results") and send via email to
   webgl_conformance_submissions@khronos.org

Please see CONFORMANCE_RULES.txt in this directory for guidelines
about what constitutes a conformant WebGL implementation.
