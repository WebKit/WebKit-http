[ 1: PASS ] WebGL context exists
[ 2: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is null
[ 3: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING query should succeed
[ 4: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : createBuffer should not set an error
[ 5: PASS ] b1 is non-null.
[ 6: PASS ] b2 is non-null.
[ 7: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : should be able to bind uniform buffer
[ 8: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is b1
[ 9: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : should be able to update uniform buffer binding
[ 10: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is b2
[ 11: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : should be able to unbind uniform buffer
[ 12: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is null
[ 13: PASS ] getError was expected value: INVALID_OPERATION : binding a deleted buffer should generate INVALID_OPERATION
[ 14: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is null
[ 15: PASS ] To define the same uniform in two uniform blocks should fail
[ 16: PASS ] UNIFORM_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT is divisible by four
