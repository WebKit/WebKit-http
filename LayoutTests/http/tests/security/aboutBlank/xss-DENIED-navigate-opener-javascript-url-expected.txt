This page opens a window to "", injects malicious code, and then navigates its opener to the victim. The opened window then tries to scripts its opener after reloading itself as a javascript URL.
Code injected into window:
<script>window.location = 'javascript:\'<script>function write(target, message) { target.document.body.innerHTML = message; }setTimeout(function() {write(window.opener, \\\'FAIL: XSS was allowed.\\\');}, 100);setTimeout(function() {write(window.opener.top.frames[1], \\\'SUCCESS: Window remained in original SecurityOrigin.\\\');}, 200);setTimeout(function() { if (window.testRunner) testRunner.globalFlag = true; }, 300);<\\\/script>\''</script>
