CONSOLE MESSAGE: The 'allow' directive has been replaced with 'default-src'. Please use that directive instead, as 'allow' has no effect.
CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load the script 'http://localhost:8000/security/contentSecurityPolicy/resources/script.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.

This script should not execute even through the second CSP header would allow it.
