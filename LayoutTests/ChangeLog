        [Qt] Fix and unskip acid2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62089

        We're unskipping acid2.html event though it's just a landing
        page for the acid2 test. Some elements of the test are loaded by
        the landing page so it is testing something, but acid2-pixel covers the same
        ground.
