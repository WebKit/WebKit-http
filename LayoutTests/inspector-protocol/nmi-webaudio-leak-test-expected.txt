This test is checking that AudioContext is deleting after navigation. It is not possible to count AudioContext objects directly. But we could use Native Memory Snapshot which has information about Page.Audio.SharedData. All the shared data are retained by HRTFDatabaseLoader refcounted singleton and Native Memory Instrumentation is visiting it via public getter. 

Action: Wait for Page.Audio data
PASS: Memory size for Page.Audio more than 15000000
Action: Navigate IFrame to resources/blank.html
PASS: IFrame was navigated to resources/blank.html
Action: Run GC and check Page.Audio data size
PASS: No Page.Audio data found
