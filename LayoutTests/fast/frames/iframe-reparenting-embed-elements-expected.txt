This test moves an iframe between two documents 3 times: without plugins, with <embed> tag and then with <object> tag.

Only the attempt without plugin elements should succeed. The presence of plugin elements should prevent the document.adoptNode() method from triggering live transfer - in which case the iframe will be reloaded.

Test succeeds if there are 'PASS' messages below and no 'FAIL' messages.

 
PASS: Test without plugins
PASS: Test with <embed>
PASS: Test with <object>
Test Finished.
