    <!-- This test is empty for now, as the syntax for exclusions
     is still under discussion. When we have a new spec draft
     available this test will define a triangular exclusion on the
     left side of the window and flow two lines of content next to
     it. Validation should check that the second line box is
     positioned farther right and has less width than the first
     line box (this will be described in the test content, and
     checked by a DumpRenderTree result) -->
