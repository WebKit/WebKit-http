getDistributedNodes() should work out of Document
PASS nodeList.length is expectedNodes.length
PASS nodeList.item(0) is expectedNodes[0]

When a content element is disconnected from ShadowRoot, it should not work.

Reprojection case
PASS nodeList.length is expectedNodes.length
PASS nodeList.item(0) is expectedNodes[0]
PASS nodeList.length is expectedNodes.length
PASS nodeList.item(0) is expectedNodes[0]
PASS nodeList.item(1) is expectedNodes[1]

rootChild is disconnected. Now content became inactive, so content element itself should be distributed.
PASS nodeList.length is expectedNodes.length
PASS nodeList.length is expectedNodes.length
PASS nodeList.item(0) is expectedNodes[0]
PASS nodeList.item(1) is expectedNodes[1]
