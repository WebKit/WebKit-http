This test confirms that the number of elements having Shadow in a shadow subtree is correctly counted. See Bug 100922 also.

Initial count should be 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 0

Inserted into / removed from an element having shadow
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 0

Inserted into / removed from an element having multiple shadow roots
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 0

ShadowRoot is added
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1

Should be counted by each shadow root (multiple shadow root case)
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(youngerShadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(youngerShadowRoot) is 1

Should be counted by each shadow root (nested shadow root case)
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 2
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 2
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 2

Should be counted by each shadow root (deep nested shadow root case)
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(deepNestedShadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(deepNestedShadowRoot) is 1
PASS internals.countElementShadow(shadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(nestedShadowRoot) is 0
PASS internals.countElementShadow(deepNestedShadowRoot) is 0

PASS successfullyParsed is true
