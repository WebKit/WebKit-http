This tests that a top layer element's containing block is in the initial containing block and that it is unaffected by
ancestor elements with overflow or opacity.  Dialog elements are used to demonstrate these properties. A dialog opened
with showModal() is in the top layer; one opened with dialog.show() is not.

<div class="pseudodialog" style="position: absolute; top: 100px; height: 250px; width: 90%; background-color: yellow">
    This modal dialog should be onscreen with a width of 90% of the page. It is the child of an narrow element
    positioned off screen, but the containing block of a top layer element is the initial containing block, so its
    position and percent lengths are relative to that.

    This modal dialog should be unaffected by its ancestor with overflow. It should not be clipped.
