CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 18: Initial reference node dimensions 800 x 600

CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 22: Post-resize reference node dimensions 810 x 610
This test checks that the yellow reference DOM node (which should be as big as the window) gets resized when the window is resized.

To avoid relayouts and repaints caused by DOM-based logging, it doesn't output anything. Please check the console for confirmation that the node dimensions increase by 10x10.
