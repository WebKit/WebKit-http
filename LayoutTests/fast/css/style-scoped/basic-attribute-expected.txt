Basic test for the <style scoped> attribute.

--- Initial ---
PASS global1.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS global1.scoped is false
PASS global2.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS global2.scoped is false
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped1, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped1.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped2, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped2.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped3, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped3.scoped is true
--- After insertion into tree ---
PASS global1.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS global1.scoped is false
PASS global2.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS global2.scoped is false
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped1, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped1.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped2, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped2.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped3, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped3.scoped is true
--- Inverting 'scoped' attribute while in tree ---
PASS testBooleanAttribute(global1, 'scoped') is true
PASS global1.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(global2, 'scoped') is true
PASS global2.scoped is true
PASS scoped1.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS scoped1.scoped is false
PASS scoped2.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS scoped2.scoped is false
PASS scoped3.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS scoped3.scoped is false
--- After removal from tree (attribute is still inverted) ---
PASS testBooleanAttribute(global1, 'scoped') is true
PASS global1.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(global2, 'scoped') is true
PASS global2.scoped is true
PASS scoped1.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS scoped1.scoped is false
PASS scoped2.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS scoped2.scoped is false
PASS scoped3.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS scoped3.scoped is false
--- Inverting 'scoped' attribute again, while outside tree ---
PASS global1.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS global1.scoped is false
PASS global2.getAttribute('scoped') is null
PASS global2.scoped is false
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped1, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped1.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped2, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped2.scoped is true
PASS testBooleanAttribute(scoped3, 'scoped') is true
PASS scoped3.scoped is true
--- DONE ---
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
