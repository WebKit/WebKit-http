Test the parsing of the cursor property.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Test a bunch of cursor rules which should round-trip exactly.
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: auto;") is "cursor: auto;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: none;") is "cursor: none;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: copy;") is "cursor: copy;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: -webkit-grabbing;") is "cursor: -webkit-grabbing;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png);") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png);"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png), crosshair;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png), crosshair;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png), url(file:///foo2.png), pointer;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png), url(file:///foo2.png), pointer;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 12 3, pointer;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 12 3, pointer;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 0 0, pointer;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 0 0, pointer;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 12 3, url(file:///foo2.png), url(file:///foo3.png) 6 7, crosshair;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 12 3, url(file:///foo2.png), url(file:///foo3.png) 6 7, crosshair;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) -2 3, pointer;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png) -2 3, pointer;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 2 -3, pointer;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 2 -3, pointer;"
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) -1 -1, pointer;") is "cursor: url(file:///foo.png) -1 -1, pointer;"

Test a bunch of invalid cursor rules which shouldn't parse at all.
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: nonexistent;") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: ltr;") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: inline;") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png), url(file:///foo2.png);") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 12;") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) 12 3 5;") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) x y;") is ""
PASS roundtripCssRule("cursor: url(file:///foo.png) auto;") is ""
PASS successfullyParsed is true
