            This text should not be autosized (its computed font-size should remain 16px), as unlike constrained-then-overflow-ancestors.html, this block's position:absolute means that its containing block is its position:relative grandparent (skipping its position:static parent with overflow-y:auto), so it does get constrained by the max-height on its grandparent (the parent has no effect).
