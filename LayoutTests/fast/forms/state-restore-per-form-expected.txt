Confirm we can restore correctly even if the order of forms are changed:
PASS $("form1-control1").value is "initial"
PASS $("form1-control2").value is "form1-control2-modified"
PASS $("form3-control2").value is "form3-control2-modified"

Confirm we ignore the query part of action URLs:
PASS $("form2-control1").value is "query-changed-control1-modified"

Confirm an additional control in the previous form doesn't take a state for the next form:
PASS $("form3-control1").value is "username-modified"
PASS $("form2-added").value is "initial"

Associated controls with form attributes are correctly handled:
PASS $("form3-outer1").value is "form3-outer1-modified"
FAIL $("form2-outer1").value should be form2-outer1-modified. Was noowner1-modified.
FAIL $("noowner2").value should be initial. Was form3-outer2-modified.
FAIL $("form3-outer2").value should be form3-outer2-modified. Was form2-outer2-modified.
FAIL $("form2-outer2").value should be form2-outer2-modified. Was initial.
PASS successfullyParsed is true
