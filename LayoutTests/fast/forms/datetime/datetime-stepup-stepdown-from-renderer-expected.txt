Check stepping-up and -down for datetime input fields from renderer. No cases of empty initial values.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Function arguments are (value, step, {min or max}, [stepCount]).
Normal cases
PASS stepUp("2010-02-10T20:13Z", null, null) is "2010-02-10T20:14Z"
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", null, null) is "2010-02-10T20:12Z"
PASS stepUp("2010-02-10T20:13Z", null, null, 10) is "2010-02-10T20:23Z"
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", null, null, 11) is "2010-02-10T20:02Z"
PASS stepUp("1970-01-01T20:13Z", "4", null, 2) is "1970-01-01T20:13:08Z"
PASS stepDown("1970-01-01T20:13Z", "4", null, 3) is "1970-01-01T20:12:48Z"
Step=any
PASS stepUp("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "any", null) is "2010-02-10T20:14Z"
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "any", null) is "2010-02-10T20:12Z"
Overflow/underflow
PASS stepUp("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "3.40282346e+38", null) is "275760-09-13T00:00:00Z"
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "3.40282346e+38", null) is "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
PASS stepUp("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "1", "2010-02-10T20:13Z") is "2010-02-10T20:13Z"
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "1", "2010-02-10T20:13Z") is "2010-02-10T20:13Z"
stepDown()/stepUp() for stepMismatch values
PASS stepDown("2010-02-10T20:13Z", "3", "2010-02-10T20:12:56Z") is "2010-02-10T20:12:59Z"
PASS stepUp("1970-01-01T00:13Z", "7", "") is "1970-01-01T00:13:04Z"
