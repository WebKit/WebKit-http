        Fixed: <rdar://problem/5520541> REGRESSION: Broken image when forwarding certain email on Tiger
        
        * WebCoreSupport/WebFrameBridge.mm: The problem was that we were loading Mail's WebKit plug-in
        too soon, which borked some necessary housekeeping on behalf of Mail. The fix is to add a quirk
        that treats Tiger Mail's WebKit plug-in like a Netscape plug-in, thus ensuring the plug-in will
        load during first layout and not attach time. For this plug-in, loading at first layout is 
        expected and is consistent with Safari 2 behavior.
