"""Module for handling messages and concurrency for run-webkit-tests.

This module implements a message broker that connects the manager to the
workers: it provides a messaging abstraction and message loops (building on
top of message_broker), and handles starting workers by launching processes.

There are a lot of classes and objects involved in a fully connected system.
They interact more or less like:

  Manager  -->  _InlineManager ---> _InlineWorker <-> Worker
     ^                    \               /              ^
     |                     v             v               |
