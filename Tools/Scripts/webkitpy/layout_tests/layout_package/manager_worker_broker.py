"""Module for handling messages and concurrency for run-webkit-tests.

This module implements a message broker that connects the manager
(TestRunner2) to the workers: it provides a messaging abstraction and
message loops (building on top of message_broker), and handles starting
workers by launching threads and/or processes depending on the
requested configuration.

There are a lot of classes and objects involved in a fully connected system.
They interact more or less like:

TestRunner2  --> _InlineManager ---> _InlineWorker <-> Worker
     ^                    \               /              ^
     |                     v             v               |
