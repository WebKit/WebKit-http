"""This is a test implementation of the Port interface that generates the
   correct output for every test. It can be used for perf testing, because
   it is pretty much a lower limit on how fast a port can possibly run.

   This implementation acts as a wrapper around a real port (the real port
   is held as a delegate object). To specify which port, use the port name
   'dryrun-XXX' (e.g., 'dryrun-chromium-cg-mac-leopard'). If you use just
   'dryrun', it uses the default port.

   Note that because this is really acting as a wrapper around the underlying
   port, you must be able to run the underlying port as well
   (check_build() and check_sys_deps() must pass and auxiliary binaries
   like layout_test_helper and httpd must work).

   This implementation also modifies the test expectations so that all
   tests are either SKIPPED or expected to PASS."""
