"""References to non-style modules used by the style package."""

# This module is a simple facade to the functionality used by the
# style package that comes from WebKit modules outside the style
# package.
#
# With this module, the only intra-package references (i.e.
# references to webkitpy modules outside the style folder) that
# the style package needs to make are relative references to
# this module. For example--
#
# > from .. style_references import parse_patch
#
# Similarly, people maintaining non-style code are not beholden
# to the contents of the style package when refactoring or
# otherwise changing non-style code. They only have to be aware
# of this module.
