# For now: Searches all files in current directory tree.
# Reads every file so it does take a while.
# On my fast computer takes about 15 seconds for WebCore.

# Things to do next:
#
#   Clever default for use on WebKit source tree instead of current directory by default.
#   Report third party sources separately from WebKit project files.
#   Skip known examples on an exception list that we don't intend to fix.
#   Replace special cases for ChangeLog, ".order", and ".xcuserstate" files with something smarter.

# Hard-coded for now, could read these out of a file instead.
# Term, then the regular expression for that term.
