# This file is a temporary hack.
# It will be removed as soon as all platforms are are ready to move to
# new-run-webkit-tests and we can then update the buildbots to explicitly
# call old-run-webkit-tests for any platforms which will never support
# a Python run-webkit-tests.

# This is intentionally written in Perl to guarantee support on
# the same set of platforms as old-run-webkit-tests currently supports.
# The buildbot master.cfg also currently passes run-webkit-tests to
# perl directly instead of executing it in a shell.
