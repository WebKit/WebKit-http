  This file contains the declaration for CppVariant, a type used by C++ classes
  that are to be bound to JavaScript objects.

  CppVariant exists primarily as an interface between C++ callers and the
  corresponding NPVariant type.  CppVariant also provides a number of
  convenience constructors and accessors, so that the NPVariantType values
  don't need to be exposed, and a destructor to free any memory allocated for
  string values.

    // Note that setting a CppVariant to a string value involves copying the
    // string data, which must be freed with a call to freeData() when the
    // CppVariant is set to a different value or is no longer needed. Normally

    // the actual object. freeData() should only be called if the CppVariant
    // is no longer needed. The other set() methods handle this internally.

    // the NP runtime nor CppVariant will ever free it.

    // are very long, avoid creating new CppVariants.
