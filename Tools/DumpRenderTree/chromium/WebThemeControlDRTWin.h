// WebThemeControlDRTWin implements the generic rendering of controls

    //              focused or otherwise active
    //   Hot      - when the mouse is hovering over a part of the control,
    //              all the other parts are considered "hot"
    //   Hover    - when the mouse is directly over a control (the CSS
    //               :hover pseudo-class)
    //   Focused  - when the control has the keyboard focus
    //   Pressed  - when the control is being triggered (by a mousedown or
