        Update our copy of the HTML5 spec used for performance testing to match the latest version
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69364

        Unreviewed.  The patch is too large to post, so landing this unreviewed. :(

        The copy of the html5 spec we were using for testing was over a year old
        and didn't have any of the subresources with it (we were only using it
        as an HTML parsing benchmark).  I'm about to use it for testing
        the full load/render time of the benchmark, so I've updated to the latest
        version of the spec (now 8mb instead of 5mb) and inlined two of the
        CSS files.  (Inlining the CSS was necessary to make my testing consistent
        as there seems to be a race with some timer fired after CSS load.)

        Increasing from 5mb to 8mb showed a similar 30% slowdown in our parser
        benchmarks as expected.

        PerformanceTests/Parser/html-parser is only testing parsing of the head element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69283

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        While investigating https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68944
        I found that the html-parser benchmark was only parsing up to the
        first script tag per loop!  We've fixed this by adding the sandbox
        tag which will deny all external loads and allow the parser to
        synchronously continue parsing the entire document to completion
        (as we had expected it was doing).

        This changes the profile somewhat.  Line number counting is much
        hotter, since we're actually accounting for the parse of the entire
        document in our sample.

        Total sample time only about doubles, from 1800ms to 3800ms on my machine
        which is less than I would have expected.
