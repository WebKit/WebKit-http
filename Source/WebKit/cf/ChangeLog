        Introduce WTF_USE_EXPORT_MACROS, which will allow us to put shared library import/export
        info into the headers rather than in export symbol definition files, but disable it on 
        all platforms initially so we can deal with port build issues one port at a time.

        WebInspector: On the way to Remote Debugging we want to transfer dom/timeline/etc
        data from inspected page to WebInspector as JSON string via http. The native
        serialization to JSON string is supported by InspectorValue's classes. This patch
        has the implementation of sendMessageToFrontend function. WebKit version of it still
        uses ScriptFunctionCall and will be switched to another transport a little bit later.
