    Returns the version number of WebKit at run-time as a string (for
    example, "531.3").

    This version is commonly used in WebKit based browsers as part
    of the user agent string. Web servers and JavaScript might use
    it to identify the presence of certain WebKit engine features
    and behaviour.

    The evolution of this version is bound to the releases of Apple's

    This macro expands a numeric value of the form 0xMMNNPP (MM =
    major, NN = minor, PP = patch) that specifies QtWebKit's version
    number. For example, if you compile your application against QtWebKit
    2.1.2, the QTWEBKIT_VERSION macro will expand to 0x020102.

    You can use QTWEBKIT_VERSION to use the latest QtWebKit API where
    available.
