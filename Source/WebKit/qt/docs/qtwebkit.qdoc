    \brief The QtWebKit module provides a web browser engine as well as
    classes to render and interact with web content.

    QtWebKit provides a Web browser engine that makes it easy to embed content
    from the World Wide Web into your Qt application. At the same time Web
    content can be enhanced with native controls.

    QtWebKit provides facilities for rendering of HyperText Markup Language
    (HTML), Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) and Scalable Vector
    Graphics (SVG) documents, styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
    scripted with JavaScript.

    A bridge between the JavaScript execution environment and the Qt object
    model makes it possible for custom QObjects to be scripted. For detailed
    documentation see \l{The QtWebkit Bridge}.
    Integration with the Qt networking module enables Web pages to be transparently loaded
    from Web servers, the local file system or even the Qt resource system.

    In addition to providing pure rendering features, HTML documents can be
    made fully editable to the user through the use of the \c{contenteditable}
    attribute on HTML elements.

    QtWebKit has been enhanced to become more attractive on the mobile front as well.
    For more information see \l{QtWebKit Goes Mobile}.

    QtWebKit is based on the Open Source WebKit engine. More information about
    WebKit itself can be found on the \l{WebKit Open Source Project} Web site.

    \section1 Including In Your Project

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet webkitsnippets/qtwebkit_build_snippet.qdoc 1

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet webkitsnippets/qtwebkit_build_snippet.qdoc 0

    \section1 Notes 

    \note Building the QtWebKit module with debugging symbols is problematic
    on many platforms due to the size of the WebKit engine. We recommend
    building the module only in release mode for embedded platforms.
    Currently QtWebKit will always be compiled without debugging symbols
    when using gcc. Take a look at the last lines of
    \c{src/3rdparty/webkit/Source/WebCore/WebCore.pro} if you need to change this.

    \note Web site icons, also known as "FavIcons", are currently not supported
    on Windows. We plan to address this in a future release.

    \note WebKit has certain minimum requirements that must be met on
    Embedded Linux systems. See the \l{Qt for Embedded Linux Requirements}
    document for more information.

    \section1 Architecture

    The easiest way to render content is through the QWebView class. As a
    widget it can be embedded into your forms or a graphics view, and it
    provides convenience functions for downloading and rendering web sites.

    \snippet webkitsnippets/simple/main.cpp Using QWebView

    QWebView is used to view Web pages. An instance of QWebView has one
    QWebPage. QWebPage provides access to the document structure in a page,
    describing features such as frames, the navigation history, and the
    undo/redo stack for editable content.

    HTML documents can be nested using frames in a frameset. An individual
    frame in HTML is represented using the QWebFrame class. This class includes the
    bridge to the JavaScript window object and can be painted using QPainter.
    Each QWebPage has one QWebFrame object as its main frame, and the main frame
    may contain many child frames.

    Individual elements of an HTML document can be accessed via DOM JavaScript
    interfaces from within a web page. The equivalent of this API in QtWebKit
    is represented by QWebElement. QWebElement objects are obtained using QWebFrame's
    \l{QWebFrame::}{findAllElements()} and \l{QWebFrame::}{findFirstElement()}
    functions with CSS selector queries.

    Common web browser features, defaults and other settings can be configured
    through the QWebSettings class. It is possible to provide defaults for all
    QWebPage instances through the default settings. Individual attributes
    can be overidden by the page specific settings object.

    \section1 Netscape Plugin Support

    \note Netscape plugin support is only available on desktop platforms.

    Since WebKit supports the Netscape Plugin API, Qt applications can display
    Web pages that embed common plugins on platforms for which those plugins
    are available. To enable plugin support, the user must have the appropriate
    binary files for those plugins installed and the \l{QWebSettings::PluginsEnabled}
    attribute must be enabled for the application.

    The following locations are searched for plugins:

    \table
    \header \li Linux/Unix (X11)
    \row \li
    \list
    \li \c{.mozilla/plugins} in the user's home directory
    \li \c{.netscape/plugins} in the user's home directory
    \li System locations, such as
    \list
    \li \c{/usr/lib/browser/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/firefox/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib64/browser-plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/browser-plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins}

    \li \c{/opt/mozilla/lib/plugins}
    \li \c{/opt/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/opt/netscape/communicator/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/netscape/plugins-libc5}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/netscape/plugins-libc6}
    \li \c{/usr/lib64/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins}
    \endlist
    \li Locations specified by environment variables:
    \list
    \li \c{$MOZILLA_HOME/plugins}
    \li \c{$MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH}
    \li \c{$QTWEBKIT_PLUGIN_PATH}
    \endlist
    \endlist
    \endtable

    \table
    \header  \li Windows
    \row \li
    \list
    \li The user's \c{Application Data\Mozilla\plugins} directory
    \li Standard system locations of plugins for Quicktime, Flash, etc.
    \endlist
    \endtable

    \table
    \header \li Mac OS X
    \row \li
    \list
    \li \c{Library/Internet Plug-Ins} in the user's home directory
    \li The system \c{/Library/Internet Plug-Ins} directory
