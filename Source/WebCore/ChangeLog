        MessageEvent.data can be stored as ScriptValue.

        Currently, the following test cases fail or crash:

        - shouldBe("new MessageEvent('eventType', { data: test_object }).data", "test_object") -> FAIL
        - new MessageEvent('eventType', { data: document }).data -> CRASH

        This is because MessageEvent.data is implemented just as SerializedScriptValue
        and it cannot keep ScriptValue passed by JavaScript. This patch makes the following changes:

        - If MessageEvent is constructed with ScriptValue, it is stored as ScriptValue internally.
        When MessageEvent.data is called, the ScriptValue is returned.
        - If MessageEvent is constructed with SerializedScriptValue, it is stored as
        SerializedScriptValue internally (since we cannot deserialize it into ScriptValue
        at this point because of lack of ExecState). When MessageEvent.data is called,
        the SerializedScriptValue is deserialized into the corresponding ScriptValue,
        and the ScriptValue is returned.

        This patch does not make a fix for ObjC bindings code, since we need to first fix
        the bug 28774, as commented in dom/MessageEvent.h and dom/MessageEvent.cpp.

        (WebCore::JSMessageEvent::data): Custom getter for MessageEvent.data. Supported ScriptValue.
        (WebCore::JSMessageEvent::handleInitMessageEvent): Changed SerializedScriptValue to ScriptValue. Removed a 'doTransfer' parameter.
        (WebCore::JSMessageEvent::initMessageEvent): Removed a 'doTransfer' parameter.
        (WebCore::JSMessageEvent::webkitInitMessageEvent): Ditto.

        (WebCore::V8MessageEvent::dataAccessorGetter): Custom getter for MessageEvent.data. Supported ScriptValue.
        (WebCore::V8MessageEvent::portsAccessorGetter): Removed extra spaces.
        (WebCore::V8MessageEvent::initMessageEventCallback): Changed SerializedScriptValue to ScriptValue.

        (WebCore::MessageEvent::initMessageEvent): Supported ScriptValue.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::isMessageEvent): Removed extra spaces.
        * dom/MessageEvent.h: Added DataType::DataTypeScriptValue.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::create): Supported ScriptValue.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::dataAsScriptValue): Getter for data. Insert ASSERT() to guarantee that this accessor is not called for unintended type of data.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::dataAsSerializedScriptValue): Ditto.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::dataAsString): Ditto.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::dataAsBlob): Ditto.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::dataAsArrayBuffer): Ditto.
        * dom/MessageEvent.idl: Changed SerializedScriptValue to DOMObject (i.e. ScriptValue). This patch does not touch an ObjC part. Removed [CachedAttribute] from MessageEvent.data, since it is now a DOMObject and needs not to be cached.
