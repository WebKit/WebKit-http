        [chromium] Don't drop children of a RenderSurface from the renderSurfaceLayerList when then position of the surface in its clipRect is not known
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87181

        Reviewed by Adrienne Walker.

        We want to avoid dropping things from the renderSurfaceLayerList on main
        thread when they may be in the renderSurfaceLayerList on impl thread due
        to animation. A render surface would drop all its children if its
        contentRect was clipped to become empty by its parent. But when the
        surface is being animated, then we can't be sure how its parent will
        clip the surface's content, so we don't clip it at all.

        [chromium] Don't force the visibleLayerRect to be empty for animating layers whose front face is not visible
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86886

        Reviewed by Adrienne Walker.

        Previously we would force the visibleLayerRect to be empty for these
        animating layers, and then special case the pre-painting code to
        paint them if they were within some size limit, to avoid having the
        layer steal too much memory.

        Instead, just use the visibleLayerRect given to the layer. Since the
        transform flips the layer such that its back face is visible, it will
        also compute a visibleLayerRect in the front face of the layer, and
        its size will be bounded by the viewport. This will cause the
        layer to be painted with visible priority instead of prepainted, but
        ensures the visible parts of the layer is painted and ready to go when
        the animation flips the layer around.

        Tidied up some beginAnimationUpdate/endAnimationUpdate logic,

        to recaclcStyle() with begin/endAnimationUpdate, but not all.
        We don't bracket layout, or compositing updates. This patch
        adds bracketing around compositing updates, in order to be
        able to add some assertions in a later patch that rely on
        RenderLayer::currentTransform() giving consistent results,
        since currentTransform() depends on the animation begin time.
        
        Made AnimationController::beginAnimationUpdate() and
        AnimationController::endAnimationUpdate() nestable by adding
        a counter.
        
        Added a stack-based class, AnimationUpdateBlock, which
        calls begin/endAnimationUpdate.
        
        Replaced calls to begin/endAnimationUpdate in Document::updateStyleIfNeeded()
        and Document::styleResolverChanged() with AnimationUpdateBlock. Filed a bug
        to cover other calls to recalcStyle which might need this (87159).
        
        Removed a call to beginAnimationUpdate() in Document::implicitOpen(),
        which was added in r42415. I believe that r57390 makes this unnecessary,
        and was not able to reproduce the original bug after removing it. It
        was the only unpaired beginAnimationUpdate call.
        
        Made AnimationControllerPrivate::getAnimatedStyleForRenderer() not 
        use a new beginTime each time it was called, so its beginTime now
        depends on some earlier beginAnimationUpdate.
        
        Fixed CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyCSSValue() to use
        an AnimationUpdateBlock so that calls to computed style do
        use the current time to compute an animating value (as before).
