// DOM binding algorithm:
//
// There are two kinds of DOM objects:
// 1. DOM tree nodes, such as Document, HTMLElement, ...
//    there classes implement TreeShared<T> interface;
// 2. Non-node DOM objects, such as CSSRule, Location, etc.
//    these classes implement a ref-counted scheme.
//
// A DOM object may have a JS wrapper object. If a tree node
// is alive, its JS wrapper must be kept alive even it is not
// reachable from JS roots.
// However, JS wrappers of non-node objects can go away if
// not reachable from other JS objects. It works like a cache.
//
// DOM objects are ref-counted, and JS objects are traced from
// a set of root objects. They can create a cycle. To break
// cycles, we do following:
//   Handles from DOM objects to JS wrappers are always weak,
// so JS wrappers of non-node object cannot create a cycle.
//   Before starting a global GC, we create a virtual connection
// between nodes in the same tree in the JS heap. If the wrapper
// of one node in a tree is alive, wrappers of all nodes in
// the same tree are considered alive. This is done by creating
// object groups in GC prologue callbacks. The mark-compact
// collector will remove these groups after each GC.
//
// DOM objects should be deref-ed from the owning thread, not the GC thread
// that does not own them. In V8, GC can kick in from any thread. To ensure
// that DOM objects are always deref-ed from the owning thread when running
// V8 in multi-threading environment, we do following:
// 1. Maintain a thread specific DOM wrapper map for each object map.
//    (We're using TLS support from WTF instead of base since V8Bindings
//     does not depend on base. We further assume that all child threads
//     running V8 instances are created by WTF and thus a destructor will
//     be called to clean up all thread specific data.)
// 2. When GC happens:
//    2.1. If the dead object is in GC thread's map, remove the JS reference
//         and deref the DOM object.
//    2.2. Otherwise, go through all thread maps to find the owning thread.
//         Remove the JS reference from the owning thread's map and move the
//         DOM object to a delayed queue. Post a task to the owning thread
//         to have it deref-ed from the owning thread at later time.
// 3. When a thread is tearing down, invoke a cleanup routine to go through
//    all objects in the delayed queue and the thread map and deref all of
//    them.
