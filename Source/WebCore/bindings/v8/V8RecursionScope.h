// C++ calls into script contexts which are "owned" by WebKit (created in a
// process where WebKit.cpp initializes v8) must declare their type:
//
//   1. Calls into page/author script from a frame
//   2. Calls into page/author script from a worker
//   3. Calls into internal script (typically setup/teardown work)
//
// Debug-time checking of this is enforced via this class.
//
// Calls of type (1) should generally go through ScriptController, as inspector
// instrumentation is needed. Calls of type (2) should always stack-allocate a
// V8RecursionScope in the same block as the call into script. Calls of type (3)
// should stack allocate a V8RecursionScope::MicrotaskSuppression -- this
// skips work that is spec'd to happen at the end of the outer-most script stack
// frame of calls into page script:
