// MemoryActivatedFont encapsulates a font loaded from another process and
// activated from memory.
//
// Responsibilities:
// * Holder for the CGFontRef & ATSFontRef belonging to the activated font.
// * Responsible for unloading the font container when done.
//
// Memory Management:
// The class is reference counted, with each instance of FontPlatformData that
// uses this class holding a reference to it.
// Entries are kept track of internally in a hash to allow quick lookup
// of existing instances for reuse:
// - fontCacheBySrcFontContainerRef() - key is the ATSFontContainerRef
//   corresponding to the *original in-process NSFont* whose loading was blocked
//   by the sandbox.
//   This is needed to allow lookup of a pre-existing MemoryActivatedFont when
//   creating a new FontPlatformData object.
//
// Assumptions:
// This code assumes that an ATSFontRef is a unique identifier tied to an
// activated font.  i.e. After we activate a font, its ATSFontRef doesn't
// change.
// It also assumes that the ATSFoncontainerRef for two in-memory NSFonts that
// correspond to the same on-disk font file are always the same and don't change
// with time.
//
// Flushing caches:
// When the system notifies us of a system font cache flush, all FontDataCache
// objects are destroyed.  This should in turn dereference all
// MemoryActivatedFonts and thus unload all in-memory fonts.
