    //        HTML5. So after we've fired an "error" event, if .preventDefault() was
    //        never called on the event, we fire an error event on the window (can't
    //        remember if this happens before or after we abort the transaction).
    //        This is a separate event, which for example means that even if you
    //        attach a capturing "error" handler on window, you won't see any events
    //        unless an error really went unhandled. And you also can't call
    //        .preventDefault on the error event fired on the window in order to
    //        prevent the transaction from being aborted. It's purely there for
    //        error reporting and distinctly different from the event propagating to
    //        the window.
    //        
    //        This is similar to how "error" events are handled in workers.
    //        
    //        (I think that so far webkit hasn't implemented the window.onerror
    //        feature yet, so you probably don't want to fire the separate error
    //        event on the window until that has been implemented)." -- Jonas Sicking
