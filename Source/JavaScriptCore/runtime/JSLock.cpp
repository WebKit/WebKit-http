// This is fairly nasty.  We allow multiple threads to run on the same
// context, and we do not require any locking semantics in doing so -
// clients of the API may simply use the context from multiple threads
// concurently, and assume this will work.  In order to make this work,
// We lock the context when a thread enters, and unlock it when it leaves.
// However we do not only unlock when the thread returns from its
// entry point (evaluate script or call function), we also unlock the
// context if the thread leaves JSC by making a call out to an external
// function through a callback.
//
// All threads using the context share the same JS stack (the RegisterFile).
// Whenever a thread calls into JSC it starts using the RegisterFile from the
// previous 'high water mark' - the maximum point the stack has ever grown to
// (returned by RegisterFile::end()).  So if a first thread calls out to a
// callback, and a second thread enters JSC, then also exits by calling out
// to a callback, we can be left with stackframes from both threads in the
// RegisterFile.  As such, a problem may occur should the first thread's
// callback complete first, and attempt to return to JSC.  Were we to allow
// this to happen, and were its stack to grow further, then it may potentially
// write over the second thread's call frames.
//
// To avoid JS stack corruption we enforce a policy of only ever allowing two
// threads to use a JS context concurrently, and only allowing the second of
// these threads to execute until it has completed and fully returned from its
// outermost call into JSC.  We enforce this policy using 'lockDropDepth'.  The
// first time a thread exits it will call DropAllLocks - which will do as expected
// and drop locks allowing another thread to enter.  Should another thread, or the
// same thread again, enter JSC (through evaluate script or call function), and exit
// again through a callback, then the locks will not be dropped when DropAllLocks
// is called (since lockDropDepth is non-zero).  Since this thread is still holding
// the locks, only it will be able to re-enter JSC (either be returning from the
// callback, or by re-entering through another call to evaulate script or call
// function).
//
// This policy is slightly more restricive than it needs to be for correctness -
// we could validly allow futher entries into JSC from other threads, we only
// need ensure that callbacks return in the reverse chronological order of the
// order in which they were made - though implementing the less restrictive policy
// would likely increase complexity and overhead.
//

// This function returns the number of locks that were dropped.
