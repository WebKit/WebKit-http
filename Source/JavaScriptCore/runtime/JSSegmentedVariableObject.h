// so long as the JSSegmentedVariableObject is alive. This allows optimizations based
// on getting the address of the variable and remembering it. As well, unlike a
// JSVariableObject, this will manage the memory for the registers itself and neither
// requires nor allows for the subclasses to manage that memory. Finally,
// JSSegmentedVariableObject has its own GC tracing functionality, since it knows the
// exact dimensions of the variables array at all times.
