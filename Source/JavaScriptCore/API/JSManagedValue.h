// JSManagedValue represents a "conditionally retained" JSValue. 
// "Conditionally retained" means that as long as either the JSManagedValue 
// JavaScript value is reachable through the JavaScript object graph
// or the JSManagedValue object is reachable through the external Objective-C 
// object graph as reported to the JSVirtualMachine using 
// addManagedReference:withOwner:, the corresponding JavaScript value will 
// be retained. However, if neither of these conditions are true, the 
// corresponding JSValue will be released and set to nil.
//
// The primary use case for JSManagedValue is for safely referencing JSValues 
// from the Objective-C heap. It is incorrect to store a JSValue into an 
// Objective-C heap object, as this can very easily create a reference cycle, 
// keeping the entire JSContext alive.
