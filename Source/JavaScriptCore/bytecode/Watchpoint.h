// InlineWatchpointSet:
//
// Do you have to emit JIT code that rapidly tests whether the watchpoint set
// is being watched?  If so, use WatchpointSet.
//
// Do you need multiple parties to have pointers to the same WatchpointSet?
// If so, use WatchpointSet.
//
// Do you have to allocate a lot of watchpoint sets?  If so, use
// InlineWatchpointSet unless you answered "yes" to the previous questions.
//
// InlineWatchpointSet will use just one pointer-width word of memory unless
// you actually add watchpoints to it, in which case it internally inflates
// to a pointer to a WatchpointSet, and transfers its state to the
// WatchpointSet.
