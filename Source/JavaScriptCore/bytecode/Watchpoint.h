//
// Do you have to emit JIT code that rapidly tests whether the watchpoint set
// is being watched?  If so, use WatchpointSet.

// If so, use WatchpointSet.

// InlineWatchpointSet will use just one pointer-width word of memory unless
// you actually add watchpoints to it, in which case it internally inflates
// to a pointer to a WatchpointSet, and transfers its state to the
