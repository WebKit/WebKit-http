// This implements the notion of an abstract state for flow-sensitive intraprocedural
// control flow analysis (CFA), with a focus on the elimination of redundant type checks.
// It also implements most of the mechanisms of abstract interpretation that such an
// analysis would use. This class should be used in two idioms:
//
// 1) Performing the CFA. In this case, AbstractState should be run over all basic
//    blocks repeatedly until convergence is reached. Convergence is defined by
//    endBasicBlock(AbstractState::MergeToSuccessors) returning false for all blocks.
//
// 2) Rematerializing the results of a previously executed CFA. In this case,
//    AbstractState should be run over whatever basic block you're interested in up
//    to the point of the node at which you'd like to interrogate the known type
//    of all other nodes. At this point it's safe to discard the AbstractState entirely,
//    call reset(), or to run it to the end of the basic block and call
//    endBasicBlock(AbstractState::DontMerge). The latter option is safest because
//    it performs some useful integrity checks.
//
// After the CFA is run, the inter-block state is saved at the heads and tails of all
// basic blocks. This allows the intra-block state to be rematerialized by just
// executing the CFA for that block. If you need to know inter-block state only, then
// you only need to examine the BasicBlock::m_valuesAtHead or m_valuesAtTail fields.
//
// Running this analysis involves the following, modulo the inter-block state
// merging and convergence fixpoint:
//
// AbstractState state(codeBlock, graph);
// state.beginBasicBlock(basicBlock);
// bool endReached = true;
// for (NodeIndex idx = basicBlock.begin; idx < basicBlock.end; ++idx) {
//     if (!state.execute(idx))
//         break;
// }
