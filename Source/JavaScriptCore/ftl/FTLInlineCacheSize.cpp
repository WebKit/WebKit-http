// the IC.

// FIXME: The ARM64 sizes are overestimates; if there is any branch compaction then we should be able
// to get away with less. The branch compaction code currently validates the size of the IC before
// doing any compaction, so we need to overestimate and give the uncompacted size. This would be
// relatively easy to fix.
