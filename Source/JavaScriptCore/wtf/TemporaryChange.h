// TemporaryChange<> is useful for setting a variable to a new value only within a

// or "var = oldVal;" at all of a block's exit points.
//
// This should be obvious, but note that an TemporaryChange<> instance should have a
// shorter lifetime than its scopedVariable, to prevent invalid memory writes
// when the TemporaryChange<> object is destroyed.
