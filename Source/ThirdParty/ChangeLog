        Unfork glu sources as much as possible.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61365

        Restore the glu sources closer to the original version on oss.sgi.com
        by removing the WebKit-specific include paths, restoring the include
        order, and renaming the glu* functions via #defines rather than in
        the source.

        * glu/README.webkit:
        Update the README to reflect the changes from trunk.
        * glu/glu.gyp:
        Add Source/Thirdparty/glu as an include path, so we can remove the
        hardcoded paths from the source files.
        * glu/gluos.h:
        Add #defines to rename the glu entry points to internal_*.
