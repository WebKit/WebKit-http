        TestWebKitApi breaks in release mode due to gtest incompatibility with fast malloc

        Disable fast malloc for offending class (::std::strstream) in gtest.
        This looks like the most non-intrusive solution.

        Unfork glu sources as much as possible.

        Restore the glu sources closer to the original version on oss.sgi.com
        by removing the WebKit-specific include paths, restoring the include
        order, and renaming the glu* functions via #defines rather than in
