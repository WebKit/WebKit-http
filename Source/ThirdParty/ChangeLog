        [chromium] remove <(library) variable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61158

        This was for a build experiment; we can just use the correct value now.

        * gyp/test/library/src/library.gyp:

        Windows production build fix

        * gtest/msvc/gtest-md.vcproj: Fix the OutputDirectory and IntermediateDirectory attributes
        for all configurations.

        A little gtest cleanup after r86287

        * gtest/msvc/gtest-md.vcproj: Added Debug_All and Production configurations to match our
        other projects. (At some point all the settings should be moved into .vsprops files to match
        our other projects, too.)
