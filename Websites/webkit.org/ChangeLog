          1. Change the various tests to get the image data for the result
             to help ensure that the operation has completed by the time,
             and subtract out the time needed to do this.
          2. Made the test more flexible about number of repetitions and
             image size.
          3. Make the tests run separately and have a pause between them
             to allow for garbage collection so that results are more
             consistent.
          4. Added a standard logging function and shouldBe asserts to
             verify that the correct scaling operations were happening.
