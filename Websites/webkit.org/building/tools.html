<h2>Installing the Developer Tools</h2>
<div class="mac-instructions">
<h4>OS X</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Install Xcode</p>
<p>Get Xcode from <a target="installtools" href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads">https://developer.apple.com/downloads</a>. Xcode 5.0 or later is required to build.</p>
<li><p>Install the Xcode Command Line Tools by running <code>xcode-select --install</code> in the Terminal.</p>
<li><p>Install Java for Mac OS X Developer Package</p>
<p>Download and install the latest OS-appropriate &ldquo;Java for Mac OS X Developer Package&rdquo; from <a target="installtools" href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads">https://developer.apple.com/downloads</a>.</p>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="windows-instructions">
<h4>Windows</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>You can build with either Visual Studio 2013 or Visual Studio 2013 express. (Newer versions currently unsupported)</p>
<p>Use the default options for the installation.</p>

<li><p>Install Cygwin</p>
<p>Cygwin is a collection of utilities for Windows that includes not only a Subversion
client, but also additional tools that are required to build the WebKit source.  We
have made a downloader available that automatically collects all of the required
packages.
<p>Download <a
href="http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/Tools/CygwinDownloader/cygwin-downloader.zip">cygwin-downloader.zip</a>.</p>
<p>Extract the content of the archive to some folder and start <code>cygwin-downloader.exe</code> from that folder.
This will download all the Cygwin packages you need.</p>
<p>When all the packages have finished downloading, the Cygwin installer will launch. Choose <b>Install from Local Directory</b>, then click <b>Next</b> until the
install is complete. If you are running Vista, the installer won't be able to launch automatically, so you will have to manually launch Cygwin's Setup.exe.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are behind a proxy you need to set the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable to the URL of the proxy. This would
likely match this pattern: <code>http[s]://[username[:password]@]somehost.com[:port]</code>. Where the square brackets ([]) are not part of the url but enclose url elements that are optional indicating that those elements might be missing in your case together with their enclosed delimiter such as @ and :.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Vista may warn you that Cygwin did not install correctly. Ignore this warning and tell Vista that the install was successful.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> If you are running Vista or Windows 7, Cygwin may have trouble with implementing <code>fork</code>
(the POSIX function frequently used to start child processes, needed by many of the WebKit build tools).
In order to enable <code>cygwin1.dll</code> to implement fork successfully it is better if no DLL loaded in the parent process is relocated at runtime.
One way to achive this is to rebase all cygwin dlls except <code>cyglsa64.dll</code> and <code>cygwin1.dll</code> to base addresses that cause them to not overlap in memory.
<p>In order to rebase all cygwin dlls a <code>rebaseall</code> script is provided in the cygwin installation's <code>bin</code> directory
(usually <code>C:\cygwin\bin</code>).
This script must be run from <code>ash.exe</code> (found in the same directory) while no other cygwin application is running.<br>
<code>ash.exe</code> has very limited command line editing features so cutting and pasting to the commandline is recommended.<br>
The <code>PATH</code> environment variable may not contain the <code>/bin</code> directory by default
thus the script should be launched as <code>/bin/rebaseall</code>.<br>
If <code>rebaseall</code> is complaining about failure to write to a Windows Temp directory (i.e. <code>/cygdrive/c/Users/you/AppData/Local/Temp</code>),
fix the permissions on that folder (i.e. <code>/bin/chown you /cygdrive/c/Users/you/AppData/Local/Temp</code>) or
change the TMP environment variable to point to a directory with the appropriate permission flags (i.e.: <code>export TMP=/tmp</code>).
<p><b>Note:</b> The rebase process may need to be repeated to include any new libraries added later to cygwin by listing these libraries by full cygwin path in a file 
and passing the file to <code>rebaseall</code> via the <code>-T fileName</code> commandline argument.
The dlls under <code>LayoutTests/http/conf</code> are a relevant use case.</p>
<p>Remove the following lines from <code>/home/[username]/.bashrc</code> (if present):
<p class=code>
<div>unset TMP</div>
<div>unset TEMP</div>
</p>
Those lines would prevent picking up the Windows TMP and TEMP environment variables.</p>
<p>If you are behind a proxy you need to do the following to allow cygwin svn to get through the proxy (similar steps are available for your Windows svn):
<ul><li>In bash (Cygwin) run: <code>svn help</code>. This will create in your cygwin home directory the file .subversion/servers.</li>
<li>Edit the file mentioned above and follow the instructions in the file to set up your proxy settings.</li></ul></p>
<li><p>Install DirectX SDK</p>
<p>Download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812">June 2010 DirectX SDK</a>  This is needed for accelerated compositing.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Python</p>
<p>Download Python 2.7.8 from <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>. When done installing, remember to add the folder of the python executable to your PATH environment variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Install php, we use the following steps (you need this to run http layout tests):</p>
<ol>
<li>cd /usr/local/bin</li>
<li>wget http://apt-cyg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apt-cyg</li>
<li>chmod a+x apt-cyg</li>
<li>Change line 341 of the apt-cyg script to "wget -nc $mirror/../$install"</li>
<li>apt-cyg -m ftp://sourceware.org/pub/cygwinports/x86 install php</li>
</ol>
<li><p>Optional: Install the 32-bit version of Debugging Tools for Windows</p>
<p>Debugging Tools for Windows includes many useful debugging tools such as WinDbg and NTSD. Some of WebKit&rsquo;s tests and scripts use these tools. Follow the <a target="installtools" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/installx86.mspx#b">instructions for installing the 32-bit version of Debugging Tools for Windows</a>.</p>
<li><p>Optional: Hotfix for 64-bit Windows to disable the user-mode callback filter for exceptions</p>
<p>Without the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976038">976038 hotfix</a>, exceptions may be thrown in callback routines that do not cause a crash but leave the application in an inconsistent state that might cause a crash later. You will need to click on "View and request hotfix downloads" and fill out the form. A link to download the hotfix and a password will be emailed to you.</p>
