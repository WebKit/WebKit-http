        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86720

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Currently EFL DRT doesn't support touch event.
        Therefore, this patch enabled it and implemented some eventSender function callbacks.

        * Source/cmake/FindEFL.cmake: Add ecore-input to dependency check.
        * Source/cmake/OptionsEfl.cmake: Enable touch event option.
